10.)Dyans Systems is developing an administration system for a Steel manufacturing company. The requirement analyst gathers the requirements of the system and the developer derives the use cases and actors for the envisioned system. A meeting of the software development team and stakeholders of the system is scheduled to take place where the stakeholders are interested in viewing the functionality, which the envisioned system will offer to each of them. You need to identify the UML diagram that needs to be created so that the stakeholders can view the correct information.

a.YOU need to create a package daigram to group the use cases based on Include and extend relationships to view the architecture from allocation viewtype.
b.You need to create a package diagram to group the use cases based on the functional module each of use cases represent view the architecture using module viewtype.
c.You need to create a package diagram where each package contains use cases used by a single actor.
d.You need to create a package diagram to group the use cases based on the actors so that each package contains use cases used by a particular actor. In addition each package should consist of the include and extend relationships for the use cases.

11.)Janes Technology is developing an online banking software system. Some of the classes of the system are:customer, bank, and account. The various interfaces for the system are: ICashWithdrawl, ICashDeposit, and IBaIanceEnquiry. The interface IConnection is created for connection with database.The components CashWithdrawl,CashDeposit, and BalanceEnquiry realize ICashWithdrawl, ICashDeposit, and IBaIanceEnquiry respectively. Similarly, ConnectionManager realizes IConnection and provides access to the  bank database.All the components of the system access the bank database. Refer to the component diagram shown in the following figure and identify the error in the component diagram.

check image_uml_q11

a.You need to depict the dependency of the ICashWithdrawl, ICashDeposit, and IBaIanceEnquiry interfaces on the ConnectionManager component because it provides access to the database.

b.You should not depict the interfaces of each of the components realized in a component diagram.
You need to depict the dependency of the ICashWithdrawl, ICashDeposit, and IbalanceEnquiry.

c.You need to depict the dependency of the CashWithdrawl, CashDeposit, and
BalanceEnquirycomponents on the ConnectionManager component because it provides access to the database.
